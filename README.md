Code in Place 2025 final project 

I, Mohammad Juned a student of Stanford Code in Place 2025, this is my final project for code in place 2025.
I am an Optometrist currently learning programming language starting with Python first. 
at a optical shop an optician uses some kind of inventory management to keep count of frames and sunglasses that inspired me to make this project that will not only do the inventory count but users can also place orders for frames and sunglasses.
This is a program that will keep count of inventory in a reatail outlet for different products, currently there are two products "Frames" and "Sunglasses". 

I am thankful to the team behind Code in Place Stanford`s CS106A course specially Professor Chris Piech, Professor Mehran Sahami, our Section leader Kainat Ijaz and my section team.
This is a programe can will keep count of products inventory in a retail store.
user can add more product in inventory. 
customer can see the availabe stocks and add the product in cart and then they can place an order for the product of their choice.
Added a login method to the inventory management system before adding the inventory so only verified users can add items in the inventory username and passward are stored in a list and dictory.

Here are the login credentials for testing the code : usernames = ["admin","juned", "user"] 
login_ids = {"admin": "admin123", "juned":"juned123", "user": "user123"}
