Code in Place 2025 final project By Mohammad Juned

I, Mohammad Juned a student of Stanford Code in Place 2025, this is my final project for code in place 2025.
I am an Optometrist currently learning programming language starting with Python first. 
at a optical shop an optician uses some kind of inventory management to keep count of frames and sunglasses that inspired me to make this project that will not only do the inventory count but users can also place orders for frames and sunglasses.
This is a program that will keep count of inventory in a reatail outlet for different products, currently there are two products "Frames" and "Sunglasses". 

I am thankful to the team behind Code in Place Stanford`s CS106A course specially Professor Chris Piech, Professor Mehran Sahami, our Section leader Kainat Ijaz and my section team.

Users can add more product in inventory by using their login credentials provided at the end of description. 

Customer can see the available stocks and add the product in cart and then they can place an order for the product of their choice.

Added a login method to the inventory management system before adding the inventory so only verified users can add items in the inventory username and password are stored in a list and dictionary.

Here are the login credentials for testing the code : usernames = ["admin","juned", "user"] 
login_ids = {"admin": "admin123", "juned":"juned123", "user":Â "user123"}


Note - For some reason Global variables are not supported in Code in Place IDE so I wrote my project in a different IDE "V S Code" , kindly use VS Code to test the submitted project for efficient result.
